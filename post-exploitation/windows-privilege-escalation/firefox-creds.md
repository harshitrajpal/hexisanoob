![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (31) (1).png>)

create a folder profile called **/root/.mozilla/firefox** and copy these files in that folder. Also, we have to rename the files as per this format:

file with name containing cert.bin becomes cert9.db

file with name containing cook becomes cookies.sqlite

file with name key4 becomes key4.db

file with name logi becomes logins.json
