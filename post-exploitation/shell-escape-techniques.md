#### 2. vi

If vi binary is allowed access in restricted shell you can:

`<Esc>=>:!/bin/bash`

#### 3. man

In one of the CTF's (brainpan) we saw an executable that was fetching manual page of an input binary.\

As you can see that **/home/anansi/bin/anansi\_util manual file** command fetches manual page. Here we can type: **!/bin/bash** \
If there is SUID set on this, you can elevate the privileges to root too.
