Steps to Reproduce -

   - Navigate to the WiJungle login page situated at local IP address.
   - Turn on the Burp Proxy. Add random username,password and capture request.
   - Send the request to intruder and launch a sniper attack with adding username and password in payload.
   - Try for most common usernames. You can use the file: https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt
   - Try for the most common passwords using various lists available online.
   - Run the attack and you will find that the WiJungle NGFW has a "NO RATE LIMIT" which allows a user to brute-force admin credentials.
   - I compromised the admin credentials on an approx combination of 30,000th payload.
