# Identification, Authentication and Authorization

Identification occurs when a user claims their identity,&#x20;

Authentication occurs when a user proves their identity, and&#x20;

Authorization occurs when identification and authentication have been done and a user needs access to resources which are otherwise restricted for un-authenticated users.

Example, in an ID card: ID number provides identification; using the ID card with password to log in to the employee portal provides authentication; and finally, using the ID card (which, lets say belongs to the data center admin) to get access to the data center provides authorization.
