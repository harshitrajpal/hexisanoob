# Group Policies

So far, we have organised users and computers in OUs just for the sake of it, but the main idea behind this is to be able to deploy different policies for each OU individually. That way, we can push different configurations and security baselines to users depending on their department.

Windows manages such policies through **Group Policy Objects (GPO)**. GPOs are simply a collection of settings that can be applied to OUs. GPOs can contain policies aimed at either users or computers, allowing you to set a baseline on specific machines and identities.

To configure GPOs, you can use the **Group Policy Management** tool, available from the start menu:

![Start menu GPM](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/b19052c41e27fbbb2651038cede63e11.png)

The first thing you will see when opening it is your complete OU hierarchy, as defined before. To configure Group Policies, you first create a GPO under **Group Policy Objects** and then link it to the GPO where you want the policies to apply. As an example, you can see there are some already existing GPOs in your machine:

We can see in the image above that 3 GPOs have been created. From those, the `Default Domain Policy` and `RDP Policy` are linked to the `thm.local` domain as a whole, and the `Default Domain Controllers Policy` is linked to the `Domain Controllers` OU only. Something important to have in mind is that any GPO will apply to the linked OU and any sub-OUs under it. For example, the `Sales` OU will still be affected by the `Default Domain Policy`.

Let's examine the `Default Domain Policy` to see what's inside a GPO. The first tab you'll see when selecting a GPO shows its **scope**, which is where the GPO is linked in the AD. For the current policy, we can see that it has only been linked to the `thm.local` domain:

As you can see, you can also apply **Security Filtering** to GPOs so that they are only applied to specific users/computers under an OU. By default, they will apply to the **Authenticated Users** group, which includes all users/PCs.

The **Settings** tab includes the actual contents of the GPO and lets us know what specific configurations it applies. As stated before, each GPO has configurations that apply to computers only and configurations that apply to users only. In this case, the `Default Domain Policy` only contains Computer Configurations:

Feel free to explore the GPO and expand on the available items using the "show" links on the right side of each configuration. In this case, the `Default Domain Policy` indicates really basic configurations that should apply to most domains, including password and account lockout policies:

Since this GPO applies to the whole domain, any change to it would affect all computers. Let's change the minimum password length policy to require users to have at least 10 characters in their passwords. To do this, right-click the GPO and select **Edit**:

This will open a new window where we can navigate and edit all the available configurations. To change the minimum password length, go to `Computer Configurations -> Policies -> Windows Setting -> Security Settings -> Account Policies -> Password Policy` and change the required policy value:

As you can see, plenty of policies can be established in a GPO. While explaining every single of them would be impossible in a single room, do feel free to explore a bit, as some of the policies are straightforward. If more information on any of the policies is needed, you can double-click them and read the **Explain** tab on each of them:

GPO distribution

GPOs are distributed to the network via a network share called `SYSVOL`, which is stored in the DC. All users in a domain should typically have access to this share over the network to sync their GPOs periodically. The SYSVOL share points by default to the `C:\Windows\SYSVOL\sysvol\` directory on each of the DCs in our network.

Once a change has been made to any GPOs, it might take up to 2 hours for computers to catch up. If you want to force any particular computer to sync its GPOs immediately, you can always run the following command on the desired computer:

Windows PowerShell

```shell-session
PS C:\> gpupdate /force
        
```

Creating some GPOs for THM Inc.

As part of our new job, we have been tasked with implementing some GPOs to allow us to:

1. Block non-IT users from accessing the Control Panel.
2. Make workstations and servers lock their screen automatically after 5 minutes of user inactivity to avoid people leaving their sessions exposed.

Let's focus on each of those and define what policies we should enable in each GPO and where they should be linked.

_**Restrict Access to Control Panel**_

We want to restrict access to the Control Panel across all machines to only the users that are part of the IT department. Users of other departments shouldn't be able to change the system's preferences.

Let's create a new GPO called `Restrict Control Panel Access` and open it for editing.&#x20;

We can do this by->group policy management->group policy objects->new policy->name it "Restrict Control Panel Access".

Then right click->edit->Userconfiguration->admin templates->control panel

Since we want this GPO to apply to specific users, we will look under `User Configuration` for the following policy:

\

Notice we have enabled the **Prohibit Access to Control Panel and PC settings** policy.

Once the GPO is configured, we will need to link it to all of the OUs corresponding to users who shouldn't have access to the Control Panel of their PCs. In this case, we will link the `Marketing`, `Management` and `Sales` OUs by dragging the GPO to each of them:

\


<figure><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/4a8f727788731b7fbf87fc079682d1a6.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

_**Auto Lock Screen GPO**_

For the first GPO, regarding screen locking for workstations and servers, we could directly apply it over the `Workstations`, `Servers` and `Domain Controllers` OUs we created previously.

While this solution should work, an alternative consists of simply applying the GPO to the root domain, as we want the GPO to affect all of our computers. Since the `Workstations`, `Servers` and `Domain Controllers` OUs are all child OUs of the root domain, they will inherit its policies.

**Note:** You might notice that if our GPO is applied to the root domain, it will also be inherited by other OUs like `Sales` or `Marketing`. Since these OUs contain users only, any Computer Configuration in our GPO will be ignored by them.

Let's create a new GPO, call it `Auto Lock Screen`, and edit it. The policy to achieve what we want is located in the following route:

\


<figure><img src="https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/44c0cde18837cb6333c78749356ac0ee.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We will set the inactivity limit to 5 minutes so that computers get locked automatically if any user leaves their session open. After closing the GPO editor, we will link the GPO to the root domain by dragging the GPO to it:

![Linking Auto Lock Screen GPO](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5ed5961c6276df568891c3ea/room-content/fcfc77d126991ffee8c927202b4dde37.png)

Once the GPOs have been applied to the correct OUs, we can log in as any users in either Marketing, Sales or Management for verification.
