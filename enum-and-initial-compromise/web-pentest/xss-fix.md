# XSS fix

1. **Input sanitization**. Demo:\
   text.replace("\<script>","#");

But it can be bypassed using a number of other payloads like \<img src=a onerror=alert("xss")>

It is a loosing strategy but can be implemented cleverly to block major malicious inputs.

2. **Using HttpOnly cookie**

**Set-Cookie: key=value; Expires=\<Date>; Secure; Httponly;**

Secure in cookie means the cookie will only be sent over HTTPS. but doesn't help against XSS

HttpOnly means JS running on page doesn't have access to that particular piece of cookie data. Instead its only accessible by the server itself.\
So, if \<script>alert(document.cookie)\</script> is run by an attacker, it will omit any cookie which has HttpOnly set.

Uses: When server is trying to store something sensitive like Session ID, server admin can mark that cookie as HttpOnly and then JS won't be able to access it.
